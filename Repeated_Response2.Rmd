## Simple Effects for Repeated Measures ANOVA Design

### Question on Repeated Measures T-Test

To address your question, let's take the first results from the Excel spreadsheet. Here you compare the levels within **order** when **proc = 1** (that is, subsetting dataset on **proc = 1**). The results you obtain are the following:

This **t-value** is based on a One-Way ANOVA. You can check this by running a one-way ANOVA in
SPSS. Here are the results:

where **sqrt(7.361) = 2.713** and the ***df*** **=** **582** (from the within or error term in the **F-test**) and identical **p-value = .007**. This one-way ANOVA however is not accounting for the dependencies in the repeated observations (the correlation between the two observations, in other words, is zero, despite the fact that both observations come from the same individual). Here is **mixed ANOVA** from the same model that considers dependency between the repeated measures:

```{r eval=FALSE}
DATASET ACTIVATE Huppert_HypocrisyProcOne_Long.
MIXED score BY order
  /CRITERIA=CIN(95) MXITER(100) MXSTEP(10) SCORING(1) SINGULAR(0.000000000001) HCONVERGE(0, 
    ABSOLUTE) LCONVERGE(0, ABSOLUTE) PCONVERGE(0.000001, ABSOLUTE)
  /FIXED=order | SSTYPE(3)
  /METHOD=REML
  /PRINT=CORB DESCRIPTIVES  LMATRIX SOLUTION TESTCOV
  /REPEATED=time | SUBJECT(id1) COVTYPE(AR1)
  /EMMEANS=TABLES(OVERALL)
  /EMMEANS=TABLES(order) COMPARE ADJ(LSD).

```

Here are the results:

![](/Users/Mark V. Brow/Desktop/Repository11/markbrow.github.io/EHuppert_HypocrisyProcOneMixed.jpg)

where **sqrt(6.019) = 2.453** and the ***df*** **=** **290**. This model accounts for the dependency of the observations. The same results can be reproduced with the **nlme** in R:

```{r eval=TRUE}
library(nlme)
setwd("C:/Users/Mark V. Brow/Desktop/Repository11/markbrow.github.io")
HypocrisyProcOne<-read.csv("Huppert_HypocrisyProcOne_Long.csv",header=TRUE, sep=",")
colnames(HypocrisyProcOne)<-c("id1","id","proc","order","time","score")
lme_proc = lme(score ~ order, data=HypocrisyProcOne, random = ~1|id1)
anova(lme_proc)
```

where **t(290) = 2.453, p = .015** . Incidentally, we can obtain the same results by specifying a contrast test in SPSS:


```{r eval=FALSE}
DATASET ACTIVATE Huppert_HypocrisyProcOne_Long.
MIXED score BY order time
   /FIXED=order time order*time
  /METHOD=REML
  /PRINT=CORB  LMATRIX SOLUTION TESTCOV
  /REPEATED=time | SUBJECT(id1) COVTYPE(AR1)
  /TEST = 'order test' order .5 -.5 order*time .25 .25 -.25 -.25.
/Execute.

```

Here is the result from the contrast test:

![](/Users/Mark V. Brow/Desktop/Repository11/markbrow.github.io/EHuppert_HypocrisyProcOneContrast.jpg)

This same result, **t(290) = 2.453, p = .015**, is obtained with the **F-test** from the **mixed** command above, as well as the result from the **nlme** package. Notice that the **contrast** test in SPSS explicitly provides a **t-value** along with corresponding ***df***.

#### Summary

In summary, the results you have obtained are based on a **one-way ANOVA** that does not account for the dependency in the repeated observations. The **mixed** models presented here do account for the dependency in the repeated observations. You may want to run the **nlme** function on the data to obtain revised estimates. I could help you with this if you would like.
